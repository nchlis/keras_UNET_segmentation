    "# Keras implementation of a UNET for image segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository provides a keras implementation of a [UNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) and tests it by performing segmentation on publicly available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data: we will use the C. Elegans data available from the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](http://localhost:8888/tree/Documents/PhD/Py_files/github_repos/keras_UNET_segmentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Input images](https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC010/BBBC010_v2_images.zip): download and extract into ./data, then delete the '\\_MACOSX' subfolder within BBBC010_v2_images. Each input image corresponds to two input channels (Brightfield/GFP). Each channel corresponds to a separate grayscale image.\n",
    "- [Target masks](https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC010/BBBC010_v1_foreground.zip): download and extract into ./data\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the segmentation mask of each image, based on the two input channels. An example image is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![demo image](./example_image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## List of files:\n",
    "- load_data.py: loads the data, splits into training, validation and test sets, and saves them to disk as numpy arrays. The images are resized to 400x400 pixels and normalized to [0,1].\n",
    "- unet_train.py: trains a UNET implemented with keras on the training data. Saves the best model according to the performance on the validation set.\n",
    "- unet_evaluate.py: evaluates the performance of the trained model on the left out test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained network achieves a median [dice score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) of 90.8% on the left out test set.\n",
